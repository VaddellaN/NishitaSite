*[Some of my favorite chicken dishes include chicken alfredo pasta (recipe below) and Hyderbad chicken byriani (pictured below).]*

In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Add chicken and season with salt and pepper. Cook until golden and cooked through, 8 minutes per side. Let rest 10 minutes, then slice. Add milk, broth, and garlic to skillet. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Add fettuccine, stirring frequently for about 3 minutes. Let cook until al dente, 8 minutes more. Stir in heavy cream and Parmesan until combined. Simmer until sauce thickens. Remove from heat and stir in sliced chicken. Garnish with parsley.

*[I also really love vegetarian foods like avacado rolls (pictured below) and pad thai (recipe below).]*

Follow package instructions to cook noodles just until tender. Rinse under cold water. Stir together fish sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar (or tamarind paste), Sriracha, and peanut butter, if using. Set aside. Heat 1½ tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp, chicken or tofu, garlic and bell pepper. Cook until meat is done. Push everything to the side of the pan. Add a little more oil and add the beaten eggs. Scramble the eggs, breaking them into small pieces with a spatula as they cook. Add noodles, sauce, bean sprouts and peanuts to the pan (reserving some peanuts for topping at the end). Toss everything to combine. Top with green onions, extra peanuts, cilantro and lime wedges. Serve immediately!

*[Of course, I have a sweet tooth and particularly enjoy pizookie (pictured below) and mango cake (recipe below).]*

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat 6 eggs on high speed 1 min until foamy. Gradually add 1 cup sugar then continue beating on high for 8 min. It will be whipped and forming thick ribbons when you pull up the whisk.In a separate bowl, whisk together 1 cup flour and 1/2 tsp baking powder. Sift flour into batter 1/3 at a time, folding between each addition. Fold just until no flour streaks remain, scraping the bottom to catch any hidden pockets of flour. Divide evenly between prepared cake pans and bake at 350˚F for 23-28 min (my oven takes 25 min). Tops should be golden brown and spring back when poked slightly. Run a knife or thin spatula around edges to loosen and invert onto wire rack. Peel back parchment paper right away. Place cakes right side up and cool to room temperature before cutting in half.Place the first sliced cake layer on a platter and spread with 1/2 cup mango purée. On the second cake layer, spread 1/2 cup frosting and place it frosting-side-down on the first layer so the cream and mango are hugging. Repeat with remaining layers then cover top and sides with remaining frosting. Pipe reserved frosting around the top border of your cake.

*[I really want to travel to Madrid, Spain for the incredible architecture, food, culure, and nightlife. Here are some things I want to do there:]*

Being one of the largest parks in the city, strolling through Retiro Park is easily one of the best things to do in Madrid if you want to escape the bustle of the city itself. It’s totally huge and well worth a visit on a nice sunny day. Once here, head on over to see the art within the 19th Century Crystal Palace, which got its influence from the one that used to exist in London. Afterwards, get your rowing on at Lago Grande which is lovely in the sunshine. Though, be warned, the sun can be really strong in those Spanish summers. Gran Via is relatively easy to visit if you’re already in Retiro Park or at the Temple of Debod. This makes it a totally easy place to explore between the more ‘concrete’ plans you’ll have for your day. Now, I always say that Gran Via kinda reminds me of Fifth Avenue in New York. It’s got that kind of vibe and lots of shopping spots, too.

*[I also want to go to Rajasthan, India because of the jaw-dropping palaces from ancient dynasties and for the bautiful landscape. Here are some things I want to do there:]*

Though Rajasthan is associated with deserts, the state also boasts some picturesque lakes that provide panorama boat tours, leaving visitors in awe with the spectacular vistas of the temples, ghats and palaces along its shores, and lush green hills in the backdrop. Some of the most breathtaking ones include Lake Pichola (Udaipur), Man Sagar Lake (Jaipur) and Pushkar Lake (Pushkar). The royal state is a sort of spiritual hub, dotted with numerous temples, each with a unique history and architectural charms that date back to the 8th and 11th centuries. This religious architecture draws people in their thousands, every year. Some of the most notable ones that you don’t want to miss when visiting include Brahma temple (Pushkar), Dilwara temple (Mount Abu), Eklingji temple kailashpuri (Udaipur), Govind Dev Ji temple (Jaipur), Mehandipur Balaji temple (Dausa) and Karni Mata temple (Bikaner).

*[I would love to visit the Bahamas for the clear blue waters and tropical climate. Here are some things I want to do there:]*

Visiting straw markets in one of those things that is often suggested by guides, as it gives you a chance to pick up souvenirs for friends or family. For decades, straw markets have been a significant part of the history of many islands in the Caribbean, such as The Bahamas. The locals use their talented hands to braid, plait and weave straw into a variety of bags and souvenirs that they in turn sell at an affordable price. Feel free to practice your bargaining stills at the Nassau Straw Market. This garden is luscious, structured, and truly historic. It oversees the Nassau Harbor nearby, has multiple platforms/terraces and has a rectangular structure about 75 feet in width. There are also monuments of great men in history, such as Napoleon, Hercules and Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States.
